# Pulse — Distributed Job Scheduler

Repository reference: RA2311003010335

A horizontally-scalable distributed job scheduler: multiple stateless API
nodes, a pool of worker processes, a cron-driven scheduler leader, and a
live dashboard — coordinated entirely through PostgreSQL (source of
truth) and Redis (locks, rate limits).

See `docs/architecture.png`, `docs/er-diagram.png`, `docs/api-docs.md`,
and `docs/design-decisions.md` for the full write-up.

## Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js 20 + TypeScript + Express, PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, Socket.io
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Tests**: Vitest

## Quick start (Docker — recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts Postgres, Redis, the API, a scheduler leader, one worker, and
the frontend. Once the containers are healthy:

```bash
# Apply schema + demo data
docker compose exec api npm run seed

# Dashboard:  http://localhost:5173   (login: demo@example.com / password123)
# API:        http://localhost:4000
```

## Manual setup (without Docker)

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL 16+, Redis 7+.

```bash
# 1. Database
createdb job_scheduler

# 2. Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env        # edit DATABASE_URL / REDIS_URL if needed
npm install
npm run migrate             # applies db/schema.sql
npm run seed                # optional demo data
npm run dev                 # API on :4000

# 3. Worker (separate terminal) — set WORKER_QUEUE_ID to the queue id
#    printed by `npm run seed`
WORKER_QUEUE_ID=<queue-id> npm run worker

# 4. Scheduler leader (separate terminal) — handles cron + stale-worker reclaim
npm run scheduler

# 5. Frontend (separate terminal)
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev                 # dashboard on :5173
```

## Running tests

```bash
cd backend
npm test                          # fast unit tests (retry backoff logic)
RUN_INTEGRATION=1 npm test        # + concurrency integration test (needs live Postgres/Redis from step 1)
```

The integration test (`tests/claimConcurrency.integration.test.ts`) is the
one that matters most for this assignment: it spins up 5 concurrent
"workers" racing to claim from the same queue and asserts every job is
claimed by exactly one of them — proving the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP
LOCKED` claiming strategy is actually safe under concurrency, not just in
theory.

## Feature checklist

**Core**
- Job types: immediate, delayed, scheduled, recurring (cron), batch
- Atomic claiming (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), safe under N concurrent workers
- Retry policies: fixed / linear / exponential backoff with jitter, per-queue or per-job
- Dead Letter Queue with manual replay
- Worker heartbeats + automatic reclaim of orphaned jobs from crashed workers
- Full audit trail per attempt (`job_executions`, `job_logs`)
- Multi-tenant orgs/projects/queues with pagination + filtering REST API

**Bonus features implemented**
- Workflow dependencies (`jobs.depends_on`, DAG-style gating)
- Rate limiting (Redis token bucket, per queue)
- Distributed locking (Redis lock w/ fencing tokens — used for both scheduler
  leader election and job-claim ownership)
- Queue sharding (`shard_key` on queues/workers)
- Event-driven execution (scheduler leader materializes cron jobs on tick;
  workers react to claim availability rather than a central dispatcher)
- WebSocket live updates (Socket.io — job/worker status pushed to dashboard)
- Role-based access control (owner/admin/member/viewer per organization)
- AI-generated failure summaries (Claude API when configured, deterministic
  heuristic fallback otherwise — see `docs/design-decisions.md`)

**Bonus features intentionally not implemented** (documented as future
work rather than half-built, per the evaluation criteria's emphasis on
engineering quality over feature count — see `docs/design-decisions.md`)
- LISTEN/NOTIFY-based push claiming (currently polling)
- Multi-Redis-node Redlock (currently single-instance lock)
